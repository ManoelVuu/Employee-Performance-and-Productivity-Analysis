## 🔍 Executive Summary

This analysis explores the key drivers of employee performance using a structured employee dataset. Insights reveal that higher salaries are linked to better performance, while training hours and workload appear to have minimal direct impact.

## 🎯 Objectives

This project was conducted to:
- Identify key drivers of high performance (salary, education, training, etc.).
- Analyze retention by comparing resigned vs. retained employees.
- Assess the impact of training and promotions on performance and satisfaction.
- Evaluate workload balance against employee satisfaction.
- Perform department and role-based performance analysis.
- Recommend optimal team structures based on performance and satisfaction.

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

**Records:** 100,000  

**Main Categories:**
- **Employee Attributes:** `Employee_ID`, `Department`, `Job_Title`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Years_At_Company`
- **Performance & Productivity Indicators:** `Performance_Score`, `Monthly_Salary`, `Work_Hours_Per_Week`, `Projects_Handled`, `Overtime_Hours`
- **Training & Satisfaction Factors:** `Training_Hours`, `Employee_Satisfaction_Score`, `Promotions`, `Resigned`

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

Data was cleaned in Excel using:
- Replacement of missing or erroneous values.
- Consistent formatting for numeric fields (e.g., salary).
- Data type corrections (e.g., date and number fields).

## 🧪 Analysis Approach

- Analysis performed in **Microsoft Excel** using **Pivot Tables**.
- Visualizations created to explore correlations and trends.
- Slicers and filters used for interactive insights.

## 📈 Key Findings

### ✅ Objective 1: Key Drivers of High Performance
- **Insight:** Higher salaries are associated with higher performance scores (Avg. Score = 4).
- **Visualization:** Avg. Performance Score by Salary Segment.

### 🔄 Objective 2: Retention Analysis
- **Insight:** No significant difference between resigned and retained employees in performance, salary, or training.
- **Conclusion:** Resignation may be driven by non-quantitative factors.

### 📚 Objective 3: Impact of Training and Satisfaction
- **Insight:** Training hours showed minimal impact on performance.
- **Conclusion:** Training quality or alignment may need improvement.

### ⚖️ Objective 4: Workload vs. Satisfaction
- **Insight:** Satisfaction scores were consistent across varying workloads.
- **Conclusion:** Other variables likely influence satisfaction more than hours worked.

### 🏢 Objective 5: Department and Role-Based Analysis
- **Insight:** No significant variation in performance or satisfaction across departments or job titles.
- **Conclusion:** Role does not significantly influence productivity metrics.

### 👥 Objective 6: Optimal Team Structures
- **Insight:** No correlation found between team size and performance/satisfaction.
- **Conclusion:** Flexibility in team size is possible without harming outcomes.
